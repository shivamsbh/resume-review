# Resume Optimizer

A web application that helps you tailor your resume to a specific job description using AI-powered analysis and suggestions.

## Overview

Resume Optimizer is a full-stack web application designed to help job seekers improve their resumes. Users can upload their resume in PDF format and provide a job description for a position they are interested in. The application then uses an AI model to analyze the resume against the job description and provides actionable suggestions to improve the resume's content and increase the chances of landing an interview.

## Features

-   **üìÑ PDF Resume Upload**: Easily upload your resume using a drag-and-drop interface.
-   **üìù Job Description Input**: Paste the job description you're targeting.
-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis**: Get intelligent suggestions on how to improve your resume based on the job description.
-   **üí° Actionable Insights**: Receive specific feedback to make your resume stand out.
-   **üì± Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **üöÄ Fast and Efficient**: Built with a modern tech stack for a smooth user experience.

## How It Works

1.  **Upload**: The user uploads their resume (PDF) and pastes a job description into the respective fields on the frontend.
2.  **Analyze**: The frontend sends the resume and job description to the backend.
3.  **Process**: The backend server extracts the text from the PDF resume.
4.  **AI Suggestions**: The extracted resume text and the job description are sent to an AI model, which generates suggestions for improvement.
5.  **Display**: The AI-generated suggestions are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user in a clear and readable format.
